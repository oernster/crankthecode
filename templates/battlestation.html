    <p>Welcome to the cockpit where the chaos gets compiled; and occasionally extruded in molten thermoplastic.</p>

    <p>
      This is my daily driver: part developer workstation, part hardware museum. Every cable, macro pad and monitor is exactly where it needs to be; mostly because it’s been there so long it’s developed squatter’s rights.
    </p>

    <p>
      The main monitor runs enough terminals, consoles and dashboards to make NORAD nervous.  
      To the left: a MacBook Air, perfect for pretending to be normal.<br />
      To the right: a Framework 13 running multiple Linux distros, because some problems are best solved with a spartan distro and a passive-aggressive script.
    </p>

    <p>
      Front and to the left of centre sits the <strong>PCPanel Pro</strong>, lighting up like a Christmas tree on amphetamines; because I enjoy tactile volume control and RGB is cheaper than therapy, along with a nice scientific calculator.  
      A <strong>StreamDeck XL</strong> with hand-labelled macros sits beside it doing everything from launching test pipelines, controlling audio using my <a href="/posts/audiodeck">AudioDeck</a> tool to muting meetings I regret joining.
    </p>

    <p>
      An auxiliary 10.1” screen serves as mission control for media, monitoring or doomscrolling when builds fail.  
      I didn’t plan on becoming a multi-display maximalist... but here we are.
    </p>

    <p>
      Audio is handled by the <strong>Focal Bathys</strong>—a HiFi headphone setup that gracefully moonlights between Discord chaos and ambient deep-space synthwave. 
      Wireless. Ridiculous. Perfect.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also running alongside is a pair of tablets: one for <strong>GameGlass</strong>, the other serving as a browser-based cockpit UI for my <strong>EDColonization Assistant</strong>. 
      Because space truckers need dashboards too.

    <h2>Flight Sim / HOTAS Setup</h2>

    <p>
      For high-immersion dogfights and questionable docking maneuvers in <strong>Elite Dangerous</strong> (and other flight sims, but let’s be honest—it’s mostly Elite), I run a full HOTAS + pedal setup:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <strong>VKB Gunfighter IV joystick</strong> with premium base<br/>
      <strong>Virpil CM3 throttle</strong> with all the throw and tension tuning a digital pilot could want<br/>
      <strong>MFG Crosswind v3 rudder pedals</strong> in graphite, because even my feet deserve nuanced control<br/>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Everything is mounted to <strong>MonsterTech hardware</strong>, which is just German for “no wobble, no mercy.”  
      The entire cockpit snaps into place like it was meant to launch me into low orbit.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Input Devices</h2>

    <p>
      Input-wise, the setup is unapologetically niche.  
      I have a small collection of <strong>Finalmouse</strong> devices because, yes, I am that kind of nerd.  
      The mouse pictured is the <strong>Achilles</strong> model - one of only 2,500 ever released. Light, sculpted and probably worth more than it should be.
    </p>

    <p>
      The keyboard is a <strong>DurGod Taurus K310</strong> with Cherry silent red switches - quiet, precise and borderline therapeutic to type on.  
      But it may soon be demoted: I’ve got a <strong>Finalmouse Centerpiece Pro</strong> on the way.  
      That model features a transparent keycap design floating above a full dynamic display and is arguably more futuristic than most sci-fi UI mockups.  
      Yes, it’s ridiculous. Yes, I’m excited. No, I don’t expect it to make me type any better.
    </p>

    <h2>3D Printing Zone</h2>

    <p>
      In a separate room lives the <strong>Printer Room</strong>, housing a curated trio of industrial-grade desktop 3D printers.  
      Each is fed by a meticulously organised filament armory below.  
      It’s a shrine to heat, motion and calibration agony - but also where entire machines are born, layer by painstaking layer.
    </p>

    <p><strong>
      No, I do <u>not</u> print guns.<br />
      Why is that always the first question?  
      3D printers like mine use plastics - great for brackets, enclosures and mechanical parts; terrible for anything ballistics-related.<br />
      If you're genuinely worried about improvised weapons, look at lathe and CNC machine owners instead of the guy printing cable clips and ABS mods.<br />
      Please stop asking. It's weird, and it says more about you than it does about me.
    </strong></p>

    <hr />

    <p>
      This setup has shipped production APIs, 3D-printed entire machines, debugged firmware over serial and hosted at least one panicked git revert at 2AM.  
      It is a monument to function over form; and somehow still standing.
    </p>

    <p><em>Yes, I dust it. Occasionally. Don’t @ me.</em></p>
