      <h1>🆘 You Clicked Help</h1>

      <p>Well. That was adorable.</p>

      <p>
        Let’s be honest: if you're on this page, something has gone horribly wrong. You were either looking for
        assistance, or you clicked this out of curiosity, which honestly makes me more worried.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is only chaos; lovingly handcrafted by someone who enjoys clean APIs and emotional suffering in equal
        measure.
      </p>

      <h2>What Now?</h2>
      <p>If you're lost, confused, or filled with the creeping dread of a misconfigured JSON file, you have two options:</p>

      <p><strong>Repent</strong>: Accept your mistakes. Turn off your machine. Walk into the sea.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Email Me</strong>: Send your cry for help to
        <span id="masked-email">[enable JavaScript]</span>.
      </p>

      <script type="text/javascript">
        // Keep the email address out of the static HTML to reduce bot scraping.
        (function () {
          const c = window.CTC_CONTACT;
          const el = document.getElementById("masked-email");
          if (!el) {
            return;
          }

          if (!c) {
            return;
          }

          // Keep the email address out of the static HTML to reduce bot scraping.
          // Display remains the normal address; only the source is JS-injected.
          el.innerHTML = `<a href="${c.link}">${c.address}</a>`;
        })();
      </script>
      <noscript>Enable JavaScript to reveal the email address.</noscript>

      <h2>Common Questions</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Q: Where is the documentation?</strong><br />
        A: Buried beneath layers of code comments and caffeine.<br />
        Honestly though, I think if you dive into <a href="https://github.com/oernster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my github</a> it reveals reasonable documentation.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Q: Can I file a bug report?</strong><br />
        A: Absolutely. You can
        <a href="https://github.com/oernster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raise an issue on GitHub</a>
        if you're feeling constructively motivated.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Q: Is this project maintained?</strong><br />
        A: In spirit, yes. In practice, also yes, somewhat surprisingly!
      </p>

      <h2>Final Note</h2>
      <p>If you think this Help page is unhelpful… congratulations. You’re finally seeing the world as it is.</p>
