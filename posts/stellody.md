I spent just over a year writing Stellody.
You can find stellody here: [Stellody](https://www.stellody.com).
It's the piece of work I'm most proud of and my crowning glory of a fully deployed app!

# Overview
Stellody is a play on words; Stellar and Melody.

Start with a local music folder or your Spotify playlists.
Stellody analyses your artists, finds similar ones, and works out the genres they belong to.
Then it generates ready-made playlists directly in Spotify — neatly sorted by genre (works with Spotify Free or Premium).

Spotify playlist mode: your playlists are retrieved automatically — no manual importing.

Deezer support is built, but currently disabled due to Deezer API restrictions.
When it’s finished, just check Spotify for your new playlists. Not on Spotify? The in-app guide explains how to transfer playlists to other services.

Runs locally — your music files never leave your computer. We only create playlists in Spotify.

It runs on Windows, Linux and MacOS.

# Why Stellody? 🌟🎶
