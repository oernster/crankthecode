I spent just over a year writing Stellody.
You can find stellody here: [Stellody](https://www.stellody.com).
It's the piece of work I'm most proud of and my crowning glory of a fully deployed app!

# Challenges along the way
Creating an app this large took time and perseverance and a LOT of caffeine and patience.
Related artists curated from the musicbrainz API using multiple lookup techniques was NOT straightforward!
Then creating alphabetically sorted custom curated sub-genre labelled playlists on top of that with sufficient artists 
in each playlist pool was another fight altogether.
The UI since I'm not really a UI developer, I'm more of a backend dev, is something of which I'm particularly proud.
That took a lot of time and effort to curate and make appear like a beautiful professional app.
Then there was the installer with a custom curated UI.
I even did dark and light modes for the installed AND the main app!
Then there was licensing so all my hard work can't be stolen by the average noob; I think I got that down pat or at least I hope so.
I think I've priced it reasonably for all license tiers and capabilities; not expensive, not free. 

# Overview
Stellody is a play on words; Stellar and Melody.

Start with a local music folder or your Spotify playlists.
Stellody analyses your artists, finds similar ones, and works out the genres they belong to.
Then it generates ready-made playlists directly in Spotify — neatly sorted by genre (works with Spotify Free or Premium).

Spotify playlist mode: your playlists are retrieved automatically — no manual importing.

Deezer support is built, but currently disabled due to Deezer API restrictions.
When it’s finished, just check Spotify for your new playlists. Not on Spotify? The in-app guide explains how to transfer playlists to other services.

Runs locally — your music files never leave your computer. We only create playlists in Spotify.

It runs on Windows, Linux and MacOS.
