# Architecture

I write from a specific method not a mood.

This space examines organisations through a **forensic lens applied to decision architecture** - not culture, not personalities, not ideology.

Decision architecture means the invisible pattern of **who decides what, why and with what authority**. It is the structure through which outcomes emerge, the thing most organisations only notice once it fails.

My focus is method not moral judgement.  
My unit of analysis is **authority, accountability and boundaries.**

When I make a claim I am locating cause rather than blaming people.  
I describe **systemic solutions** to structural misalignment rather than cataloguing human behaviour.

This is practical clarity:  
- I trace the flow of decision rights,  
- I expose breaks in accountability chains,  
- I propose corrective design where necessary.

This is not cultural commentary.  
This is **architectural clarity**.

Such clarity is not popular because it is dispassionate. It is useful because it is precise.

That is the lens.
