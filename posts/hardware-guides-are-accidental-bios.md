Lessons from the chaos of printer setup, upgrades and inevitable regret.

## Problem → Solution → Impact

**Problem:** 3D printer setup documentation rarely reflects the messy reality of building, modding and tuning.

**Solution:** Honest guides written post-failure serve as better references than pristine, manufacturer-style docs.

**Impact:** They help others skip the pain and jump straight into printing, tuning and tweaking.

# Rationale

Every hardware guide is secretly a personal history. The steps, the gotchas, the upgrades ~ they're not just instructions, they're embedded memories of pain and triumph.

I’ve maintained deep upgrade/setup notes for:
- [`tronxy-klipper-vzbot-guide`](https://github.com/oernster/tronxy-klipper-vzbot-guide)
- [`QidiQ1Pro`](https://github.com/oernster/QidiQ1Pro)

Neither is a one-size-fits-all template but both are survival manuals: full of caveats, hacks, calibration logs and config tweaks.

People sometimes ask if I plan to consolidate them. I don’t. The fragmentation *is* the point.

Each guide is a snapshot of what mattered during that particular war with thermistors, wiring, or firmware.

These aren’t instructions. They’re journals.
