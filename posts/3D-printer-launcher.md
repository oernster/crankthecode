I developed: [3D printer launcher](https://github.com/oernster/3D-Printer-Launcher).
I do a lot of 3D printing and construction/playing with electronics and software relating to 3D printing.
This is a simple launcher tool written in python and PySide6 you can use and integrate with OBS Studio to 
display real time data while printing
