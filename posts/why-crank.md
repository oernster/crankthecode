Everyone asks why.  
Nobody asks *why not crank*.

This blog exists because I was tired of bloated platforms, slow render times, and markdown parsers that don’t understand me emotionally.

So I wrote my own.  
In FastAPI.  
Using Markdown.  
With tags nobody uses.

## Things I refuse to do

- Use WordPress
- Pay $9/month to blog
- Pretend I like Medium
- Give up control over fonts

## Things this blog will include

- Rants
- Projects I will rewrite later
- Possibly cursed Python
- Possibly cursed JavaScript pretending it’s clever

Welcome. You’re part of this now.
