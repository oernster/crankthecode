[EDColonisation Assistant](https://github.com/oernster/EDColonisationAssistant) 🛰  
Browser-based tool for managing colonisation tracking and expeditions in *Elite Dangerous*.

[Releases](https://github.com/oernster/EDColonisationAssistant/releases/)

## Problem → Solution → Impact

**Problem:** Coordinating colonisation efforts and managing fleet carriers in *Elite Dangerous* lacks a centralised, structured tool ~ especially during expeditions or station build-outs.

**Solution:** A browser-based cockpit tool that tracks infrastructure requirements, build-out progress, system / station 'shopping lists' and real-time carrier inventory.

**Impact:** Enables commanders to efficiently manage space station construction, resource logistics, and fleet carrier assets ~ streamlining both solo and group colonisation efforts.
