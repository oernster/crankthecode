Musings on bots as communication layers, not novelty features.

## Problem → Solution → Impact

**Problem:** Bots are often viewed as simple command wrappers rather than intentional design choices in user interaction.

**Solution:** By treating bots as interfaces ~ bridging tools, APIs and humor ~ we can create more useful and usable automation.

**Impact:** Brings personality and accessibility to technical functionality through conversational, purposeful design.

# Rationale

Somewhere between laziness and genius lies the bot.

I've written many bots ~ some useful, some absurd. My 3D printer Discord bot ([snark3Dprinter-discord-bot](https://github.com/oernster/snark3Dprinter-discord-bot)) lives in a private channel, announcing printer states, errors, job completions and the occasional snarky quip.

It's not *just* about notifications. It's about *how* that information reaches you. Bots let you interact with your systems like they’re members of your team: always on, never unionising.

This isn't a deep dive into SnarkAPI again (that got its own post). Instead, it's a reflection on how bots let me wrap practical automation with enough personality to make it delightful.

Also, if a bot insults you, you're not allowed to take it personally. That's in the RFC.
