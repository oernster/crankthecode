# When normal mechanisms stop working

Most organisations are designed to operate in steady state.

They assume roles are clear, authority flows predictably and decisions can be made within existing structures. Most of the time, this works well enough.

Occasionally, however, an organisation enters a situation where these assumptions no longer hold. Delivery slows despite effort. Coordination costs rise. Responsibility fragments. Everyone is busy but nothing seems to move.

At this point, organisations often respond by adding process, oversight or additional management layers. These measures can stabilise symptoms but they rarely address the underlying cause.

*Some problems cannot be solved by the same structures that created them.*

## The failure mode

When delivery fails repeatedly, the root cause is often described in human terms. Skill gaps, motivation, communication and alignment are cited.

In practice, the deeper issue is usually structural.

Decision authority is unclear or overly concentrated. Risk is pushed upward. Responsibility exists without mandate. Choices that affect product behaviour require permission rather than judgement.

The organisation still appears to function but decisions take longer to make. That latency propagates into planning, execution and code.

By the time this is visible as a delivery or performance problem, the real failure has already occurred.

*The system has lost the ability to decide in time.*

## Why hierarchy struggles here

Hierarchies are effective at allocating responsibility and maintaining control. They are less effective at resolving situations where authority itself is the problem.

When decision rights are misaligned, adding layers tends to increase signalling, defer accountability and reward caution. Feedback slows and escalation becomes routine.

Middle layers are then asked to absorb ambiguity they cannot resolve. Senior layers become overloaded with decisions that should not require escalation. Everyone feels the drag but no one can safely name it.

At this point, the organisation is no longer optimising for outcomes. It is optimising for stability.

*This is not incompetence. It is an emergent property of the structure.*

## The missing role

There is a class of intervention that does not fit neatly into line management, project management or steady-state leadership.

Its purpose is not to manage delivery or people but to surface where decisions actually stall, redesign authority boundaries, reduce coordination load and restore the organisation’s ability to decide early and clearly.

This work operates above individual teams and below abstract vision. It focuses on interfaces. Between product and engineering. Between responsibility and authority. Between intention and execution.

It is most effective when normal escalation paths are part of the problem, delivery issues are systemic rather than local and change cannot be forced without making things worse.

*This kind of intervention is necessarily limited in scope and duration. It is not a permanent organisational layer.*

## A useful metaphor

Iain M. Banks described a group in his Culture novels tasked with operating only in exceptional situations, where normal structures could not achieve a desired outcome.

They intervened sparingly, preferred minimal force and withdrew when change could not be absorbed.

The important part of that metaphor is not power or secrecy. It is restraint.

Intervention was justified only when the system could not resolve the problem internally, the cost of inaction exceeded the cost of change and the intervention itself would not become a new source of harm.

*The goal was not control but resolution.*

## Constraints matter more than capability

This kind of role is easy to misunderstand.

It is not a licence to override leadership, a substitute for accountability or a way to bypass trust.

In fact, it fails quickly in organisations that cannot delegate authority, treat challenge as threat or optimise primarily for stability.

In those environments, the correct outcome is often not transformation but exit.

*Forcing change that a system cannot absorb creates more damage than delay.*

## How this shows up in practice

When this intervention works, the outcomes are subtle. Decisions move closer to information. Escalation decreases. Teams stop waiting for permission. Product behaviour becomes simpler and more predictable.

When it fails, the signals are equally clear. Authority remains symbolic. Decisions continue to bottleneck. Coordination load increases. The organisation reverts to control.

*These signals matter because they indicate whether continued effort will reduce latency or merely mask it.*

## In closing

Not every organisation needs this kind of intervention.

But when decision latency becomes systemic, adding more structure rarely helps. What is required is a deliberate redesign of authority, responsibility and decision flow.

That work does not belong in the middle of the hierarchy. It operates at its boundaries.

Some circumstances are not normal.

*Recognising them early and knowing when to intervene or walk away is a form of organisational maturity.*
