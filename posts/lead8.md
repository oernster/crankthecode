# When leadership is not the goal

I am not interested in producing more leaders.

I am interested in making responsibility visible, structural failure legible and authority alignment unavoidable. When leadership arises naturally from that, it is a by-product, not an objective.

This distinction matters because much of what is described as leadership today is an attempt to compensate for structural absence rather than a response to genuine necessity.

## The problem with encouraged leadership

When organisations decide they need more leaders, they usually mean they need more people willing to take responsibility without the authority to act.

This produces familiar patterns. Individuals are encouraged to step up. Influence is praised. Initiative is rewarded. Ambiguity remains.

Leadership becomes an activity rather than a condition. People are asked to navigate around the structure rather than change it. Progress depends on persuasion, resilience and personal credibility instead of design.

This is not leadership development. It is load redistribution.

## Authority before leadership

When authority aligns with responsibility, something quieter happens.

Decisions are made where the information lives. Escalation becomes rarer. Initiative no longer requires permission because the boundaries are clear.

In these conditions, some people naturally lean in. Others do not. Both responses are valid.

Those who lean in are not aspiring to leadership. They are responding to the presence of real authority and clear responsibility. They act because action is now possible without workaround.

This is leadership as a consequence, not a goal.

## Why this matters

Treating leadership as an objective creates perverse incentives.

People optimise for visibility. Influence becomes currency. Politics emerges where clarity is absent. The organisation mistakes motion for progress and personality for capability.

Treating leadership as a by-product does the opposite.

It removes the need to perform. It reduces the value of informal power. It makes leadership situational, temporary and accountable rather than aspirational and permanent.

Most importantly, it allows people who do not want to lead to remain effective without being pressured into roles they neither need nor want.

## What this stance excludes

This approach does not produce leadership pipelines, development tracks or high potential programmes.

It does not reward charisma or ambition. It does not teach people how to influence without authority.

It assumes that if leadership is required, the structure is incomplete. And if leadership must be continuously encouraged, something else has already failed.

## In practice

In well aligned systems, leadership appears when needed and recedes when it is not.

People with judgement act. Others support or decline. The organisation continues without drama.

Nothing about this needs to be promoted.

It simply needs to be allowed.
