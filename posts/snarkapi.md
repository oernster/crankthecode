# Snark-as-a-service API
[SnarkAPI live site](https://snarkapi.com/)

## Problem → Solution → Impact

**Problem:** Building humour or personality into software interfaces is time-consuming and often skipped.

**Solution:** SnarkAPI provides a simple HTTP interface that returns sarcasm-infused messages for use in apps, bots, and chat interfaces.

**Impact:** Makes it easy to inject wit and attitude into user experiences without hand-coding text logic. [Live at snarkapi.com](https://www.snarkapi.com)

# Rationale
I wanted to roast IT devs/operators and do it publicly!

# Overview
Public sarcasm-as-a-service. Yes, it’s real. No, I won’t apologize.
It's a minimal FastAPI service that returns a sarcastic quote with some IT crowd quotes thrown in for good measure.
