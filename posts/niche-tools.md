blurb: "Because general-purpose tools are rarely personal."
one_liner: "Tiny tools with weird, specific use cases that somehow keep solving problems."

One-size-fits-most tools don’t cut it when you live on the edge cases.

## Problem → Solution → Impact

**Problem:** Mass-market tools rarely solve edge-case workflows. Most are bloated, generalised, or just a little wrong.

**Solution:** Write tiny, fast, personalised tools that do one thing well and fit the exact gap in your system.

**Impact:** You gain confidence in your stack, reduce friction and sometimes others get lucky enough to benefit from your weird tools.

# Rationale

Most of my projects started because *I* had a problem.

That makes the tool narrow. That makes it fast. That makes it *right*.

These aren’t the kinds of tools that go viral or hit product hunt. They’re the kind that:
- live in a `bin/` folder
- get symlinked across three systems
- save me two clicks every day

These are niche by design. That’s why they work.
