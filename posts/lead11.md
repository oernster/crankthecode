# Accountability without authority at scale

Programme management roles often appear senior, powerful and well-positioned.

They span teams, budgets and timelines. They sit in steering meetings. They speak the language of delivery and risk.

Yet when complex initiatives fail, programme management is frequently where blame settles.

*This is not accidental.*

## The illusion of seniority

Programme management is structurally expansive but vertically constrained.

The role coordinates across domains but rarely owns them. It integrates work without controlling the systems that produce it.

Authority typically remains elsewhere:
- with product leadership
- with design authorities
- with executive sponsors
- with functional silos

Programme managers see the whole but they do not decide the parts.

*This creates a role that looks senior while remaining dependent.*

## Visibility without mandate

Programme management is highly visible.

Plans, milestones, dependencies and risks are surfaced through the programme layer. Reporting flows upward through it. Escalations pass through it.

This visibility creates a powerful optical effect:
- if something slips, the programme is seen to slip
- if alignment fails, the programme appears mismanaged
- if outcomes disappoint, coordination is questioned

Visibility, however, is not authority.

*The role exposes problems it cannot resolve structurally.*

## Where blame naturally accumulates

When authority is fragmented, organisations need a place for failure to land.

Programme management is structurally convenient:
- it is central
- it is legible
- it is already framed in terms of delivery

Blame does not require malice. It follows the path of least resistance.

*If a role is accountable for outcomes but cannot change the decisions that shape those outcomes, blame will accumulate there over time.*

## Decision latency in disguise

Programme management often exists to manage the consequences of slow or contested decision-making.

When authority is unclear:
- decisions escalate late
- trade-offs are deferred
- risk is surfaced without being absorbed

The programme layer absorbs the resulting turbulence.

Schedules are reworked. Dependencies are renegotiated. Communication intensifies.

*The system appears to be managed, while the underlying decision latency remains untouched.*

## Why competence does not protect the role

Highly competent programme managers can delay failure, smooth friction and maintain momentum.

This often makes the structural problem harder to see.

As long as coordination compensates for authority gaps, the organisation avoids confronting them.

Eventually, however, complexity exceeds coordination capacity.

*At that point, competence is reinterpreted as insufficiency.*

## A structural limit, not a performance issue

Programme management fails not because it is poorly executed but because it is asked to compensate for missing authority.

No amount of planning can substitute for:
- clear decision ownership
- enforceable trade-offs
- aligned incentives

When these are absent, the programme role becomes a buffer between unresolved power structures and delivery reality.

*Buffers absorb impact. They are not thanked for it.*

## Closing observation

Programme management roles absorb blame because they are designed to.

They sit where outcomes are visible and authority is diffuse.

Until organisations align decision rights with accountability, these roles will continue to carry responsibility for failures they are not empowered to prevent.

This is not a leadership failure.

*It is a structural one.*
