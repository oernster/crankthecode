# Chaos Contained: Tables, Taglines and Terminal Fakery 🧪

It’s been a busy few days of updates to the blog - the kind of work that’s 70% polish, 20% debugging things that used to work and 10% wondering why I did any of this in the first place.

But here we are. Highlights below.

---

## ✨ Site-wide Enhancements

- **Landing page tables updated**  
  Reorganised and re‑styled all tech/category/project tables. They now include updated iconography and hover states that actually look like someone cared.

- **Call to Action added (finally)**  
  You’ll now find a polite nudge at the base of the landing page if you’re here to hire me, collaborate, or just stare at the chaos.

- **About Me updated**  
  The page now reflects my physics background with exactly the level of smugness you'd expect. Also added a full skillset snapshot - yes, including TTCN‑2, because I refuse to forget it.

- **Meta tag upgrades for SEO + social**  
  Every post and image now includes SEO-friendly metadata and social embed previews for Discord, LinkedIn and Twitter. Go ahead - share a post and marvel at how shockingly professional it looks.

## 🧠 Blog Post Improvements

- **Problem → Solution → Impact** added to all posts  
  Because recruiters apparently love this format. Now they can find the words “impact,” “problem,” and “solution” without needing to read between the sarcastic lines.

- **AxisDB got fake terminals with working copy buttons**  
  This was weirdly difficult and required multiple sacrifices to the layout gods. But it's done. And it works. And you can click the copy icon like a real hacker.

- **Calendifier post cleaned up**  
  Tables now look presentable enough to survive a meeting with a product manager.

- **Stellody post improved + competitive roast added**  
  Some very subtle (read: not subtle) commentary was added on certain online “music engines” that basically just shuffle Spotify playlists and charge you for it.

## 🔎 Search Autocomplete (yes, seriously)

The autocomplete search now works. Properly. And smoothly. And I only had to fight the frontend, backend, edge cases, weird caching bugs, browser autofill quirks and possibly a minor existential crisis to get it working. But hey - it’s fast now.

Try typing “sarcasm” or “json” and be amazed.

## 🆘 Help Button Deployed

There’s now a **Help** button on the landing page. Clicking it takes you to a lovingly unhelpful page that explains, in no uncertain terms, that there is no documentation and there never will be.

Bots are warned. Humans are welcome to email me (if they enable JavaScript first).

---

## 🧪 Testing Brag

Unit test coverage has been increased to **100%**.  
Yes, I wrote tests.  
Yes, I tested the tests.  
No, this doesn’t mean the code won’t still betray me in production - but at least now I’ll know *why*.

---

## That’s All (For Now)

If you’ve made it this far down the update:  
- You’re either a very determined recruiter  
- Or my future self checking whether I remembered to write this post  
- Or a robot sent from the future, in which case: nice try, pal

Either way, thanks for reading.

As always, you can explore the chaos, file a bug, or just press random buttons until something interesting happens.
