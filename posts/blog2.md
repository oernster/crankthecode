# Chaos Contained: Tables, Taglines and Terminal Fakery

It has been a busy few days of updates to the blog. This was the sort of work that is mostly polish mixed with debugging things that used to work and a small amount of questioning earlier life choices.

But here we are. Highlights below.

---

## ✨ Site-wide Enhancements

- **Landing page tables updated**  
  All tech category and project tables were reorganised and re-styled. Iconography was updated and hover states were added so the UI now looks intentionally designed rather than accidentally assembled.

- **Call to Action added (finally)**  
  A clear but restrained call to action now lives at the base of the landing page for anyone looking to hire, collaborate, or simply observe the chaos.

- **About Me updated**  
  The page now reflects my physics background with an appropriate level of confidence. A complete skillset snapshot was added including TTCN-2 which I refuse to pretend never happened.

- **Meta tag upgrades for SEO + social**  
  Every post and image now includes SEO friendly metadata and social embed previews for Discord LinkedIn and Twitter. Sharing a post now looks deliberate and slightly alarming in its professionalism.

## 🧠 Blog Post Improvements

- **Problem → Solution → Impact added to all posts**  
  This structure was applied consistently across posts so intent and outcome are visible without having to decode the sarcasm.

- **AxisDB got fake terminals with working copy buttons**  
  This required more effort than expected and several minor layout sacrifices. The result is interactive terminal output with functional copy buttons that behave like they belong there.

- **Calendifier post cleaned up**  
  Tables were reformatted so they can survive a meeting with a product manager without causing immediate concern.

- **Stellody post improved with competitive commentary**  
  Additional commentary was added comparing Stellody with certain online music engines that mostly reshuffle Spotify playlists and invoice you for the privilege.

## 🔎 Search Autocomplete (yes, seriously)

Search autocomplete now works properly and smoothly. Implementing this involved frontend backend edge cases caching issues browser autofill quirks and a brief but meaningful existential crisis.

The end result is fast predictable and usable.

Try typing “sarcasm” or “json” and enjoy the illusion of effortlessness.

## 🆘 Help Button Deployed

A **Help** button now exists on the landing page. Clicking it leads to a page that explains very clearly that there is no documentation and there never will be.

Bots are warned. Humans are welcome to email me provided they enable JavaScript first.

## 🧪 Testing Brag

Unit test coverage has been increased to **100%**.  
Yes I wrote tests.  
Yes I tested the tests.  
No this does not mean the code will not still betray me in production but at least now I will know why.

## That’s All (For Now)

If you made it this far down the update:
- You are either a very determined recruiter  
- Or my future self checking whether I remembered to write this post  
- Or a robot sent from the future in which case nice try  

Either way thanks for reading.

*-As always you can explore the chaos file a bug or press random buttons until something interesting happens.*
