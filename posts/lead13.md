# Requirements without resolution

Large organisations often appear well-prepared for complexity.

They have architects. They produce documentation. They circulate diagrams, specifications and approved designs.

These artefacts create a sense that requirements are understood and settled.

*Often, they are not.*

## The comfort of artefacts

Architecture documents answer important questions.

They describe the system shape, constraints, interfaces and preferred patterns. They reduce technical uncertainty and narrow the solution space.

What they do not do is decide between competing interpretations of need.

In stakeholder-dense environments, multiple parties care about outcomes for different reasons. Regulatory bodies, customers, delivery teams and sponsors often use the same words to mean different things.

Documentation can capture these perspectives without resolving them.

*Artefacts create the appearance of closure without providing it.*

## Stakeholder density and ambiguity

As the number of stakeholders increases, so does ambiguity.

Each additional voice introduces another interpretation of priority, risk or success. Without an explicit mechanism for collapse, these interpretations coexist.

This is not dysfunction. It is the natural state of complex systems.

The problem arises when ambiguity is exposed to delivery without a way to resolve it.

*In stakeholder-dense systems, requirements do not emerge organically. They must be owned.*

## Architecture is not authority

Architecture constrains how systems can be built.

Authority determines which trade-offs matter.

These are different functions.

Being given architectural guidance does not confer the right to decide which stakeholder demands are binding, which can be deferred, or which can be ignored.

Architecture answers “how.”

Authority answers “which interpretation wins.”

*When these are conflated, engineers are left operating inside a bounded space without knowing which direction is safe.*

## Escalation as a system property

In healthy organisations, ambiguity is temporary.

When requirements conflict or remain unclear, they can be pushed upward until someone with decision authority collapses them. Once collapsed, work proceeds with confidence.

This is not politics. It is how systems close open questions.

Escalation is not a personal skill. It is a structural capability.

*When escalation paths are explicit, uncertainty has somewhere to go.*

## When escalation paths are implicit

In large organisations, escalation is often assumed rather than defined.

Roles are named. Titles exist. Documentation circulates. Yet no clear path exists for challenging or refining requirements beyond the artefacts already provided.

For those without organisational standing, reputation or time in role, escalation becomes risky or unavailable.

Ambiguity remains visible but immovable.

*When escalation paths are implicit, uncertainty becomes permanent.*

## Responsibility without resolution

In this state, engineers are expected to make progress while carrying unresolved ambiguity.

They must interpret requirements without knowing which interpretations are defensible. They must commit without knowing where authority truly sits.

From the outside, this looks like hesitation or lack of clarity.

From the inside, it is exposure without protection.

*The system has surfaced requirements but denied the means to resolve them.*

## Why this fails quietly

Because documentation exists, the organisation believes it has done its part.

Because delivery is slow or cautious, the problem is attributed downward.

The absence of resolution is mistaken for indecision.

*Unresolved ambiguity does not announce itself. It simply degrades confidence.*

## Closing observation

Access to information is not access to authority.

Requirements clarity depends less on the volume of documentation than on the availability of escalation.

When organisations expose people to requirements but deny them the means to resolve competing interpretations, ambiguity hardens into delivery risk.

This is not a communication failure.

*It is a structural one.*
