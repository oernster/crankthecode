title: On Working with Machines
---

Understanding machine behavior without mythologising it.

## Problem → Solution → Impact

**Problem:** We project intent and emotion onto machines that can’t interpret them, then get frustrated by the mismatch.

**Solution:** Treat machines like what they are ~ rule-based input/output systems with zero awareness.

**Impact:** Less frustration, better design, clearer expectations and a deeper understanding of tool limitations.

# Rationale

Machines don’t care about intent. They aren’t mystical, clever, or rebellious.

They just:
- respond to inputs
- follow constraints
- give output.

That’s the contract.

And the better we respect that contract, the better we build with them, automate with them and coexist with them.

Whether it’s AI models, APIs, firmware, or even your 3D printer’s startup gcode ~ it’s all just rules. No emotion. No second-guessing.

Let the human be human. Let the machine be a machine.
