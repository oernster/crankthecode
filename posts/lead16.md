title: Decision load as a structural signal

# If the CTO is making too many decisions

Tooling has accelerated execution.

Code is produced faster. Prototypes appear sooner. Iteration cycles compress.

This is often celebrated as productivity.

*Acceleration increases the rate at which decisions surface.*

When more decisions surface the organisation feels busier. Technical discussions multiply. Architectural debates become more frequent. Escalations increase.

In this environment it can feel natural for the CTO to lean in.

*It can also be a structural mistake.*

## The diagnostic

A CTO being pulled into too many decisions is not a sign of engagement.

It is a sign of unclear decision surfaces.

When teams escalate routinely it usually means one of three things.

> Decision boundaries are undefined.  
> Authority has been delegated informally rather than structurally.  
> Escalation rules are ambiguous.

None of these are personality problems.

*They are operating model failures.*

## The symptom often looks like this.

> The CTO is in design reviews that do not cross domains.  
> The CTO is resolving disagreements that should sit within a team.  
> The CTO is asked to validate decisions that have already been made.

The calendar fills. Strategic work slips. Cognitive space narrows.

The role begins to resemble a senior engineer of last resort rather than a system designer.

*Decision load increases when authority design is incomplete.*

## Why acceleration makes this worse

When execution slows, the cost of unclear authority is hidden by latency.

When execution accelerates the cost becomes visible.

More features mean more interfaces.  
More interfaces mean more trade offs.  
More trade offs mean more opportunities for conflict.

If boundaries are unclear escalation becomes the default risk management strategy.

Escalation feels prudent.

It is often structural leakage.

*Acceleration amplifies weak boundary design.*

## The sharp question

If the CTO is making more decisions each quarter rather than fewer the operating model is regressing.

A healthy CTO role reduces its own decision load over time.

The early phase of a company may require concentrated authority. Boundaries are immature. Context is fragmented.

That phase should not persist.

If it does the organisation has not designed delegated authority. It has normalised dependency.

*Permanent centrality is a structural failure not a badge of importance.*

## How to respond

The response is not to withdraw abruptly.

The response is to redesign the surface on which decisions land.

Start by naming decision domains explicitly.  
Assign clear decision owners within those domains.  
Define which categories must escalate and why.  
State explicitly which decisions will not escalate.

This must be written and visible.

Informal delegation collapses under pressure.

The CTO must also refuse casual override. When a domain owner makes a bounded decision it should stand unless it crosses a defined threshold.

Trust is not motivational.

It is structural protection.

*Delegated authority must be defended not announced.*

## Preserving strategic space

The purpose of delegation is not to reduce workload.

It is to preserve cognitive space for cross domain trade offs and long horizon direction.

The CTO should be deciding where systems intersect.  
The CTO should be resolving conflicts between product ambition and technical constraint.  
The CTO should be designing the next boundary not adjudicating the last argument.

When the role is functioning well the organisation experiences fewer escalations not because decisions disappear but because they land where they belong.

*The CTO designs decision surfaces rather than absorbing decision volume.*

Acceleration will continue.

The question is whether authority design keeps pace with it.

If the CTO is overwhelmed the system is telling you something.

*Listen to it.*
