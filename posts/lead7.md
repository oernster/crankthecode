# When competence becomes a liability

Some organisations appear to function because a small number of highly capable people quietly make them work.

Problems are anticipated. Gaps are filled. Decisions are nudged forward informally. Work continues.

From the outside, this looks like resilience. From the inside, it is often something else.

## Competence as insulation

Highly competent people reduce friction. They notice ambiguity early. They compensate for missing clarity. They adapt.

This is valuable in the short term. It keeps systems running. It prevents visible failure.

But it also insulates the organisation from its own weaknesses.

When capable individuals absorb uncertainty, structural problems remain hidden. Leadership never feels pressure to change decision paths or authority boundaries because the outcomes appear acceptable.

The system does not learn because it is not allowed to fail.

## When individual capacity replaces structure

In extreme cases, one or two unusually capable engineers can mask the absence of structure. Through speed, judgement and informal coordination they can produce the same visible output as much larger teams operating under clearer authority.

This is often celebrated as exceptional talent. In practice it is a warning sign. The organisation is not benefiting from leverage or design. It is consuming individual capacity to compensate for systemic gaps.

The apparent efficiency is real but it is not durable.

## The silent tax

This compensation carries a cost.

It requires political navigation, informal alignment and decisions made off the record. It relies on personal trust, availability and credibility. It demands cognitive load that is rarely acknowledged.

None of this appears in plans or dashboards.

Over time, the most competent people become the busiest, the most relied upon and the least replaceable. They are praised for reliability while quietly carrying work the system should be doing for itself.

What looks like strength is often deferred fragility.

## Why promotion makes it worse

In many organisations, demonstrated competence leads to additional responsibility rather than clearer authority.

Capable people are given more scope, more expectations and more dependencies without the mandate required to simplify or redesign the underlying structure.

Their effectiveness becomes proof that the system works.

The role expands but the decision surface does not.

As a result, the behaviour spreads. Others learn that progress depends on personal effort rather than structural clarity. Informal networks grow. Official processes are bypassed.

The organisation becomes dependent on individuals it cannot easily replace.

## The organisational blind spot

Leadership often attributes this state to culture, commitment or grit.

When outcomes are good, the system is praised. When outcomes deteriorate, individuals are blamed.

The structure itself is rarely examined.

As long as competent people continue to absorb friction, there is no incentive to address authority misalignment, unclear interfaces or decision latency.

The organisation appears stable until it is not.

## When systems are carried

Competence is essential. It is not the problem.

The problem arises when competence becomes a substitute for structure.

When progress depends on who is capable enough to compensate, the system is no longer designed. It is merely being carried.

And systems that rely on being carried eventually fail in ways no individual can prevent.
