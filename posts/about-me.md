# About me

Hi, I’m Oliver. I’m a CTO-level technical and engineering leader who specialises in reducing organisational and technical risk by deciding early and clearly.

I have extensive experience working across defence, telecoms, fintech and startup environments, often in situations where systems are complex, constraints are real and ambiguity is unavoidable. Over time, my focus has shifted from implementation to technical direction, governance and decision-making, while staying close enough to the ground to keep judgement honest.

I still build real systems with real constraints, for engineers, teams and the occasional stakeholder who believes “just add AI” is a strategy.

Across my career I’ve worked with everything from lean startups to multinational behemoths, solving problems ranging from “how do we modernise a legacy PHP monolith without losing our minds” to “can we please stop the satellite from spying on itself.” I’ve led teams of 17 on mission-critical defence programmes, delivered full-stack cloud-native platforms solo and, at various points, dabbled in the dark arts of React with something approaching dignity.

I also happen to have a physics degree, which means I spent several years learning how to model chaotic systems, question assumptions and accept that uncertainty is not a failure mode. That mindset shapes how I approach software, with curiosity, rigour and an instinct for spotting when systems are about to go thermodynamically wrong.

Outside of work, I keep my hands dirty by building and rebuilding systems from first principles, including designing and assembling multiple generations of 3D printers. That mix of hardware, electronics, firmware and software is a useful reminder that systems tend to fail at boundaries rather than in isolation.

My GitHub is a collection of experiments, tools and the occasional “I wonder if this is possible” moment. Some of it is practical, some of it is exploratory and some of it exists purely because curiosity won.

I built this site from scratch as a place to think in public, part portfolio, part notebook and part playground. If you’re here to hire me, collaborate or simply browse the results of a long-running fascination with complex systems, you’re very welcome. If you’re a robot sent from the future to judge my code, that’s fine too.

*I don’t just build software; I debug the unintended consequences.*
