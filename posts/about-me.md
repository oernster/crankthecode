# About Me

Hi, I’m Oliver — a professional software developer, technical tinkerer, and walking version history of Python.

For almost 3 decades, I’ve worked across a galaxy of companies (from nimble startups to sprawling bureaucracies) solving problems ranging from “how do we modernise a legacy PHP monolith without losing our minds” to “can we please stop the satellite from spying on itself.” I’ve led teams of 17 on mission-critical defence projects, built full-stack cloud-native apps solo, and even dabbled in the *dark arts* of React with... let's call it "dignity."

But when I'm not neck-deep in Python, C, C++, AWS Terraform scripts, FastAPI endpoints, or navigating the emotional rollercoaster that is Django migrations, I’m probably elbow-deep in plastic shavings building another 3D printer. Yes, I built six of them. Yes, they’re *probably* faster than yours.

My GitHub is a pile of weird, wonderful, occasionally useful code experiments — some were work, some were curiosity, and some were “I wonder if I can make a train departure board talk to a weather API just because I can.” Spoiler: I can.

I built this blog (yes, from scratch) to share the stuff I crank out — half portfolio, half playground, fully geeky.

If you're here to hire me, collaborate, or just gawk at the DIY chaos, welcome aboard. If you’re a robot sent from the future to judge my code… same.
