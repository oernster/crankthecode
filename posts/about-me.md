# About me

Hi, I’m Oliver - a professional software developer, technical tinkerer, and walking version history of Python, C++ and C; as well as more obscure mobile phone conformance testing languages such as TTCN-2.

I build real systems with real constraints—for engineers, teams, and that one stakeholder who thinks ‘just add AI’ is a strategy.

For almost 3 decades, I’ve worked across a galaxy of companies (from nimble startups to sprawling bureaucracies) solving problems ranging from “how do we modernise a legacy PHP monolith without losing our minds” to “can we please stop the satellite from spying on itself.” I’ve led teams of 17 on mission-critical defence projects, built full-stack cloud-native apps solo, and even dabbled in the *dark arts* of React with... let's call it "dignity."

I also happen to have a physics degree, which means I spent several years learning how to model chaotic systems, question reality, and accept that sometimes the laws of nature are simply uncooperative. That mindset seeps into how I build software - with curiosity, rigour, and an instinct for spotting when things are about to go *thermodynamically wrong*.

But when I'm not neck-deep in Python, C, C++, AWS Terraform scripts, FastAPI endpoints, or navigating the emotional rollercoaster that is Django migrations, I’m probably elbow-deep in plastic shavings building another 3D printer. Yes, I built six of them. Yes, they’re *probably* faster than yours.

My GitHub is a pile of weird, wonderful, occasionally useful code experiments - some were hard work, some were curiosity, and one was even “I wonder if I can make a train departure board talk to a weather API just because I can.” Spoiler: I can.

I built this blog (yes, from scratch) to share the stuff I crank out - half portfolio, half playground, fully geeky.

If you're here to hire me, collaborate, or just gawk at the DIY chaos, welcome aboard. If you’re a robot sent from the future to judge my code… same.
