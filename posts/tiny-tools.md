title: Tiny Tools I Refuse to Live Without
---

A personal stash of micro-utilities that quietly fix annoyances.

## Problem → Solution → Impact

**Problem:** Tiny CLI or utility tools often get overlooked despite saving hours of time and cognitive load.

**Solution:** Curating and sharing a personal toolkit of small, well-scoped utilities.

**Impact:** Helps others discover useful tools without wading through thousands of repos or blog spam.

# Rationale

There are tools I use regularly that are so fundamental to my workflow, they’ve become invisible. This post shines a light on a few of them  ~  not full projects but utility scripts, weird one-offs and general cleverness that I’ve relied on across multiple builds.

These aren't all in one repo. Think of them as a toolkit scattered across:
- [`recover-steam-icons`](https://github.com/oernster/recover-steam-icons)
- [`animated-svg-gif-converter`](https://github.com/oernster/animated-svg-gif-converter)
- [`simple-search`](https://github.com/oernster/simple-search)
- selected [`utils`](https://github.com/oernster/utils)

They’re weird, single-minded and kind of beautiful.

# Highlights

- **Recover Steam Icons**: Because Steam nukes your custom icons every update. This prevents irrational rage.
- **SVG to GIF Converter**: When you *need* to embed something in Notion and GIFs are all they understand.
- **Simple Search**: Quick search through a local dump of docs or logs without spinning up Elasticsearch.
- **Utils**: Assorted madness from JSON CLI processors to dodgy wrappers I regret writing but refuse to delete.

These tiny tools are the duct tape of my digital life.
