Curiosity-driven system exploration without setting off alarms.

## Problem → Solution → Impact

**Problem:** Hacking is often conflated with chaos or criminal intent, which misrepresents its true value.

**Solution:** Reframe hacking as structured curiosity ~ understanding, modifying and exploring systems safely.

**Impact:** Encourages more developers to explore without fear and builds respect for ethical system design.

# Rationale

Hacking doesn’t have to mean chaos, exploits, or hoodie clichés.

Sometimes it just means:
- understanding how something works
- tracing behavior back to assumptions
- refusing to accept “that’s just how it is.”

Curiosity is the skill.
Restraint is the difference between learning and breaking things.

Most of the time, the goal isn’t access.
It’s comprehension.

And comprehension scales.
