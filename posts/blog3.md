# Command Centre Update

## ✨ What’s New?

The site now includes an unapologetically excessive [**Battlestation**](/battlestation) page complete with high resolution images of my actual desk and 3D printer setup. Yes it is real. No I did not clean the cables. Yes I am aware of what that implies.

The goal was not aesthetics for their own sake but transparency. This is the environment where the work happens and pretending otherwise felt dishonest.

### 🧠 Hero Section Overhaul

- Added a more professional and succinct intro block that makes a few things immediately clear:
  - 28 years of development experience.
  - A degree in physics which explains both my fondness for entropy and my tolerance for chaos.
  - An open invitation to collaborate observe or quietly judge.

The tone was tightened but not sanitised. It still sounds like me which matters more than sounding corporate.

### 🖥️ New: Command Battlestation Page

- A full HTML writeup of my workspace with photos.
- Clear descriptions of hardware input devices and the 3D printing area.
- Snark carefully calibrated between harmless sarcasm and mild concern.

**Includes:**

- Rare Finalmouse Achilles (2.5k units worldwide).
- Durgod Taurus K310 with Cherry silent reds.
- PCPanel Pro because RGB apparently feeds the soul.
- Multi distro Linux chaos via a Framework 13.
- A printer room with real functional machines rather than decorative filament sculptures.

The intent here is not to flex hardware but to show the practical constraints and tooling behind the work.

## 🛑 Pre-emptive Mythbusting

A clarification was added early and explicitly:

> **No I do not print guns. Please stop asking.**  
> You should worry more about people with lathes and metal CNC machines than those with printers and PETG.

This saves time later.

## 🧼 Cleanup & UX Polish

- Image layouts were tidied with proper aspect ratio handling.
- Long sections were broken up with visual interludes to improve readability.
- Cropping issues were resolved so nothing important is cut off including the monitor which deserves its full moment.
