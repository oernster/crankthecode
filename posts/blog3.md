# Command Centre Update

## ✨ What’s New?

The site now includes an unapologetically excessive [**Battlestation**](/battlestation) page, complete with high‑resolution images of my actual desk and 3D printer setup. Yes, it’s real. No, I didn’t clean the cables. Yes, I know what that says about me.

### 🧠 Hero Section Overhaul

- Added a *more professional + succinct* intro block that subtly flexes:
  - 28 years of dev experience.
  - A degree in physics (because entropy and I are close friends).
  - My open invitation to collaborate, gawk, or judge quietly.

### 🖥️ New: Command Battlestation Page

- Full HTML writeup of my workspace, with photos.
- Added descriptions of my hardware collection, input devices and 3D printing room.
- Carefully adjusted snark levels between “harmless sarcasm” and “mildly alarming insight into my psyche.”

**Includes:**

- Rare Finalmouse Zeus (2.5k units worldwide).
- Durgod Taurus K310 (Cherry silent reds = bliss).
- PCPanel Pro (RGBs for the soul).
- Multi-distro Linux chaos via Framework 13.
- Printer room with real functional machines, not just IKEA filament art.

## 🛑 Pre-emptive Mythbusting

Also included a firm but polite clarification:
> **No, I do not print guns. Please stop asking.**  
> You should worry more about people with lathes and metal CNC machines than those with printers and PETG.

## 🧼 Cleanup & UX Polish

- Tidied image layout with proper aspect ratio handling.
- Broke up battlestation monologue with visual interludes.
- Ensured nothing vital is cropped (my monitor deserves its full moment).

As always, if something looks broken, it's your browser’s fault. If it works flawlessly, it's definitely mine.

Catch you in the next changelog. Or the Help page. Probably the Help page.
